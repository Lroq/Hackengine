### Run the program with CLI
Run the **Hack Engine** for the first time you need to write :

```bash
npm install 
npm start
```

To run the server next times you can use :
```bash
npm start
```

After that, open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:80/](http://localhost:80/) to use the hack engine.

The server will be hosted on your localhost address on the port **80**

> ❗A firewall warning may appear, be trustfully 😊 some firewall need that to host the server on your localhost address.
